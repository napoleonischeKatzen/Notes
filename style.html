The shortest string which contain all permutations of a set of <i>n</i> elements is what?\n
<a href="#chapter1"><b>Chapter I: The Structure of Permutations</b></a>
\n
&emsp; <div id="chapter1">A</div> permutation is a finite sequence of elements of a set; the length of a permutation <i>w</i> is its number of elements and if a permutation has the length at least <i>i</i> then \(w(i)\) is its <i>i</i>th letter. A permutation of length <i>n</i> has the elements \([n]={1,2,...,n}\) and each element exist exactly once; therefore permutations are a special type of elements of the positive integer numbers \(\mathbb{P}\). Two permutations \(u,v\in\mathbb{P}^{n}\) which have the same length <i>n</i> and have positive integer elements are order-isomorphic if with all indices \(i,j\in[n]\) there is \(u(i)>u(j)\Longleftrightarrow v(i)>v(j)\).
